## Disaster Response Classification with Pipelines

### 1. Deployment Link
https://project-disaster-response.herokuapp.com/

### 2. Instructions to run locally:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`
    
2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5500/

### 3. Project Overview
In this project, I applied data engineering to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

_data_ directory contains a data set which are real messages that were sent during disaster events. I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that appropriate disaster relief agency can be reached out for help.

This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

### 4. Project Components
There are three components of this project:

#### 4.1. ETL Pipeline

File _data/process_data.py_ contains data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the `messages` and `categories` dataset
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a **SQLite database**

#### 4.2. ML Pipeline

File _models/train_classifier.py_ contains machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the **SQLite database**
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs result on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

#### 4.3. Flask Web App

Running `python run.py` **from app directory** will start the web app where users can enter their query, i.e., a request message sent during a natural disaster, e.g. _"Please, we need tents and water. We are in Washington, Thank you!".
